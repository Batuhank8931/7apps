3. Scalability and Performance Optimization
Consider how your application will handle larger volumes of data and concurrent users:

a. Caching Frequently Asked Queries
Implement caching to improve response times for frequently asked queries. You can use Redis for this:

Cache responses from the Gemini API.
Serve cached responses for repeated queries.
b. Concurrency and Rate Limiting
Optimize your application to handle concurrent requests:

Use FastAPIâ€™s built-in support for asynchronous operations.
Implement rate limiting to protect against abuse, using tools like slowapi or fastapi-limiter.
4. Unit and Integration Testing
Testing is crucial to ensuring your application works as expected:

a. Unit Tests
Write unit tests for individual components like:

PDF processing.
Gemini API integration.
Database interactions.
b. Integration Tests
Write integration tests to verify that all components work together smoothly:

Test the complete workflow from PDF upload to chat response.
Include edge cases, such as invalid PDF files or API errors.
Example Using pytest
python
Kodu kopyala
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from app.main import app

client = TestClient(app)

def test_upload_pdf():
    response = client.post("/v1/pdf", files={"file": ("test.pdf", open("test.pdf", "rb"))})
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert "pdf_id" in response.json()

def test_chat_with_pdf():
    pdf_id = "some-unique-id"
    response = client.post(f"/v1/chat/{pdf_id}", json={"message": "What is the main topic of this PDF?"})
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert "response" in response.json()
5. Documentation
Ensure your documentation is thorough and clear:

a. README.md
Include:

Project overview.
Detailed setup instructions, including environment configuration.
Explanation of API endpoints with request/response examples.
Testing procedures and instructions for running the test suite.
b. API Documentation
FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation at /docs.
Make sure the endpoint documentation is clear and accurate.
6. Bonus Points Considerations
a. Gemini API Evaluation
Consider questions like:

Is using the Gemini 1.5 Flash with 1 Million context size enough, or would Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) be a better approach?
How do you handle queries that exceed the output token limit (8196 tokens)?
b. Performance of LLM
Evaluate the performance of the Large Language Model:

Analyze response times.
Consider ways to optimize or improve the interaction with the LLM.
Final Steps
Review Your Code: Ensure it follows Python best practices.
Test Thoroughly: Make sure everything works as expected.
Deploy: If possible, deploy your application to a cloud service for a live demonstration.
Submit: Prepare your final submission package with code, documentation, and instructions.
